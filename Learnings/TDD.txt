Test Driven Development - TDD
===============================

1. Test First Development - Write Tests->Fail Tests->Write Code->Run Tests--->Fix Bugs-->No Bugs--->Refactor if required.

2. Red (Test's Fail)-Green (Tests's Pass)-Refactor(Renaming method, splitting complex method into multiple etc).

3. Entity classes - Pure getter and setter alone, should not have Unit Tests. No need. waste of time.

4. Test should force the design changes.  If a module is not testable, need to change the design.

5. Each TestCase should be stateless

6. A test case should test the core functionality. Not getters and setters.

7. Develop everything as stateless.  You develop differently.
